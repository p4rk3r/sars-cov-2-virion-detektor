##Rationale

* Create an early warning system to detect SARS-COV-2 in droplets aerosols with 2 main objectives:

1) Identify biohazardous spaces that have been contaminated by COVID-19 carriers so they can be immediately sterilized
2) Identify those carriers (specially the asymptomatic ones) so they can be isolated and treated (and stop transmission)
