# SARS-COV-2-Virion-Detektor
Attempt to use particle counting technology as a potential means to detect COVID-19.

Starting source

["The potential for screening and tracking of covid-19 using particle counters (version 2)](https://necsi.edu/the-potential-for-screening-and-tracking-of-covid19-using-particle-counters)

## Rationale

Create an early warning system to detect SARS-COV-2 in droplets aerosols with 2 main objectives:

 1) Identify biohazardous spaces that have been contaminated by COVID-19 carriers so they can be immediately sterilized
 2) Identify those carriers (specially the asymptomatic ones) so they can be isolated and treated (and stop transmission)

## Technologies / Instruments

* SMPS (Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer) spectrometers with UV light
* Aerodynamic Particles Sizer - UV radiation
* Raman spectroscopy

## Raman spectroscopy
